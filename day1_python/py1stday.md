# Day 1: Python Basics Revision

Welcome to **Day 1** of your Python revision journey! This repository contains a collection of fundamental Python programs designed to help you revise the core concepts of the language. By completing these exercises, you'll reinforce your understanding of variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, functions, and more.

## What You'll Learn on Day 1

### 1. Variables
Learn how to define variables and use them to store data, such as integers, floats, and strings. 

Example:
```python
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width
```

### 2. Basic Input and Output
Revise how to gather user input using `input()` and display output using `print()`.

Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### 3. Arithmetic Operations
Review basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

Example:
```python
result = 5 + 3 * 2
```

### 4. Conditional Logic
Recall how to control program flow using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements for decision-making based on conditions.

Example:
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```

### 5. Lists
Refresh your knowledge on how to define and manipulate lists, as well as finding maximum and minimum values using `max()` and `min()`.

Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
print(max(numbers))  # Output: 5
print(min(numbers))  # Output: 1
```

### 6. String Manipulation
Brush up on string handling skills, including slicing, reversing, and checking for palindromes.

Example:
```python
text = "madam"
if text == text[::-1]:
    print("This is a palindrome.")
```

### 7. Functions
Revise how to create and use functions to encapsulate code into reusable blocks.

Example:
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### 8. Looping and Iteration
Go over loops, specifically `for` and `while`, and practice iterating over lists and sequences.

Example:
```python
for num in range(1, 6):
    print(num)
```

### 9. Modular Arithmetic
Refresh your understanding of using the modulo operator (`%`) and integer division (`//`) for tasks like even/odd checks and date conversions.

Example:
```python
days = 400
years = days // 365
remaining_days = days % 365
print(f"{days} days is {years} years and {remaining_days} days.")
```
