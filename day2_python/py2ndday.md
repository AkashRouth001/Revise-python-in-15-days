# 📝 Day 2: Diving Into Variables & Data Types in Python

Welcome to **Day 2** of your Python revision journey! Today, we're cracking open the essentials of variables, data types, and operators that form the backbone of any Python program. 🐍

## 🔍 Understanding Variables
A variable is essentially a name assigned to a memory location to store values. Let’s explore:

```python
a = 30  # A variable to store an integer
b = "Harry"  # A string variable
c = 71.22  # A floating-point number
```

### ⚡ Quick Tip:
- Variables = containers to store data.
- Keywords = reserved words in Python.
- Identifiers = names for variables, functions, or classes.

## 📊 Data Types in Python
Python offers a wide range of data types, but here are the core ones you'll use the most:
- **Integers** ➡️ `a = 30`
- **Floating-point numbers** ➡️ `b = 31.22`
- **Strings** ➡️ `c = "Python"`
- **Booleans** ➡️ `d = True`
- **None** ➡️ `e = None`

---

## 🎯 Rules for Naming Identifiers
Follow these simple guidelines when naming variables:
- Variable names can include **letters, digits**, and **underscores**.
- They **must start** with a letter or underscore.
- They **cannot start with a digit**.
- Avoid using spaces or special characters.

Examples: `my_var`, `one8`, `_private`, `seven`

## ⚙️ Operators in Python
Python supports a variety of operators:
1. **Arithmetic Operators** ➡️ `+, -, *, /`
2. **Assignment Operators** ➡️ `=, +=, -=`
3. **Comparison Operators** ➡️ `==, >, <, !=`
4. **Logical Operators** ➡️ `and, or, not`

## 🔍 The `type()` Function & Typecasting
Want to know the data type of a variable? Use the `type()` function! 🧪 Plus, you can convert between data types with typecasting.

```python
a = 31  
print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>

b = "31" 
print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

### 🌟 Typecasting Examples:
```python
str(31)     # "31"   (int to string)
int("32")   # 32     (string to int)
float(32)   # 32.0   (int to float)
```

---

## 🖥️ The `input()` Function
The `input()` function lets users enter data from the keyboard, and it always returns it as a string.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
**Note:** Even if the user enters a number, the input will be a string by default!
