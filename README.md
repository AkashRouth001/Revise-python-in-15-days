# 15-Day Python Revise

## Overview

*15-Day Python Revise* is a comprehensive Python course designed for beginners and intermediate learners who wish to master Python in just 15 days. This course covers Python fundamentals, including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, strings, lists, dictionaries, file handling, and more. The program provides daily lessons with reading materials, examples, and quizzes to reinforce learning through practical exercises and programming challenges.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into 15 daily sessions, with structured lessons over the first 8 days, each focusing on specific concepts to build your Python skills progressively.

### Learning Approach:
- *Daily Lessons*: Focus on key topics with clear explanations and hands-on practice.
- *Reading Materials*: Comprehensive reading materials to guide you through each concept.
- *Example Questions*: Practice problems to help you apply the concepts you’ve learned.
- *Quizzes*: Every lesson includes a quiz with 10 programming challenges to test your understanding and build problem-solving skills.
- *Final Days*: Review and work on more complex challenges to consolidate your Python knowledge.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Python basics: Variables, data types, input/output
- Conditional statements: if, else, elif
- Loops: for, while
- Functions: Defining and calling functions
- Strings: Operations, slicing, formatting
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries: Data structures and their usage
- File handling: Reading from and writing to files

## Practice & Quizzes

Each day ends with a *quiz* that includes 10 programming challenges based on the day’s lesson. These quizzes are designed to help you apply and solidify your understanding of the topics.

- *Example Questions*: Every day includes a set of example problems to give you hands-on experience.
- *Programming Challenges*: Quizzes focus on real-world problems to help you develop problem-solving skills and improve your coding proficiency.

## Course Goal

By the end of this 15-day course, you will be:
- Comfortable with Python’s core features.
- Able to write Python scripts to solve common programming problems.
- Equipped to continue exploring advanced Python topics or apply your knowledge to other fields, such as data science, web development, or automation.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming knowledge is required. This course is suitable for absolute beginners, but it can also be helpful for individuals with some programming experience who want to strengthen their Python fundamentals.

## How to Use This Course

1. *Follow the Daily Lessons*: Each day’s topic builds on the previous ones, so it’s essential to go through them in order.
2. *Practice*: Make sure to complete the example questions and quizzes each day.
3. *Review*: At the end of the course, revisit the lessons and work on more complex problems to reinforce your skills.
